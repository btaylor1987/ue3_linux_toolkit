Introduction

If your game supports things like custom DLCs (new skins etc...), then you'll probably want to make a new package instead of a texture pack.
The users of your mod will then copy this package into the appropriate folder and follow your instructions to enable the new DLC.

It is not recommended to use this functionality to override the game's "official" packages as it will conflict with other mods.
It is possible to inject textures directly into the new package, as well as modifiy object properties (such as materials, names, etc...)

Step 1: Set a working folder

	The first thing to do is to set a working folder, for example c:\Workspace.
	This is where file will be exported to, and textures will be imported from

Step 2: Open a package

	Select advanced mode, and open the package you want to work with, from your game installation folder.

From then on you can either inject textures into your package or modify object properties.
Both will let you save a copy of the package. You will need to close the package and re-open it if it needs further modification (ex: after injection textures, open the copy to modify the properties)

Step 3: Inject textures (Optional)

	See step 3 and 4 in "Instructions - Texture packs" about exporting and processing your textures.
	Click on the "Inject textures" tab.
	You should see your modified texture, and if you inject them in the package it will save a modified copy.
	No texture pack or TFC files will be created, the textures will be stored within the package to avoid conflicts with other mods in the installation folder.
	You should close the package at this point. If you need to modify object properties, open the newly created copy.
	
Step 4: Editing object properties (Optional)
	
	Go to the package tab and you will be able to see the package content.
	You can edit the names table (your game may or may not support longer names)
	You can also edit the properties of the objects under the objects tab
	This is useful if you are making a new custom skin and need to update material values, as well as giving your skin a unique name.
	Depending on the content of your package, you may also be able to swap meshes within the same package, or even make a mod that has nothing to do with textures... This might make the game crash, or not. You will have to experiment and find out :-)
	Once you are done you can save a copy of the package.
	You should close the package, and if you need to inject textures into, open the newly created copy.

You can then upload this new package, and the users of your mod will not need TFC installer as your package already contains all the modified textures and properties.
