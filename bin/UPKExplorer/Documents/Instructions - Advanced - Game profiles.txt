Game profiles are .xml files that can be found un the GameProfiles\ directory.
They are used by both UPK Explorer and TFC installer to:
- detect the game from the package version/licensee version found in the profile
- map out the package folders
- determine where the game's TFCs are located
- determine what suffix the TFC files (Texture2D_xxx.tfc) will use. Warning: You should not modify this for the original game directories.
- determine if the game exe needs to be patched for hash check (some game exe contain package names to validate with a checksum, the patcher removes these names so the packages can be modded)
- enable or disable the use of TFC when generating a texture pack (so the texture pack will be generated with textures that have local only mipmaps)

When a texture pack is created, the game profiles is exported with it, and TFC installer will load that profile when the texture pack is opened.

Game profiles can also be used to exclude some packages or even directories.
This is useful if you have modded files in your game installation that you do not want to be opened by UPK Explorer or modified by TFC installer.

SampleProfile.xml is provided as documentation and provides examples.
